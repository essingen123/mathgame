**Project & Design Principles**
First MVP / functional prototype coded on a mobile. Yes, quite
wonderful, it actually did work. 
 Tradeoffs in code structure prioritizing faster testing and practicality; using a minimal of files
 and skipped code quality to clean up later.  
 
**Installation** 
 Minimal timeless fuzz in current version. Just open in a browser with access to sufficent local storage. 
 
**AI Usage** 
Close to none in the running implementation. During desktop code clean up sessions - improvements were done using 
the quite amazing CoPilot AI-assistant from Github.
