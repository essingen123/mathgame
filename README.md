**Project & Design Principles**
First MVP / functional prototype coded on a mobile. Yes, quite
wonderful, it actually did work. 
 Tradeoffs in code structure / quality prioritizing practicality; using a minimal of files
 and skipped code quality to clean up later.  
 
**Installation** 
 Minimal timeless fuzz in current version. Just open in a browser with access to sufficent local storage. 
 
**CoPilot AI** 
During desktop code clean up sessions - improvements were done using 
the quite amazing CoPilot AI-assistant from Github.
