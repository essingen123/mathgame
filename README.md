# Math Game Pi
Coded mostly on a mobile, so the code is mostly put into one file.

It's quality with tabbing and consistency were of second priority. Focus was just that it runned to clean up later, if useful / gameplay fun enough. 
 During desktop coding improvements using the a companion; the coding AI-assistant from Github. Quite amazing thingy this CoPilot.
